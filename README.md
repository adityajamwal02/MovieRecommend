## PROBLEM STATEMENT

Providing related content out of relevant and irrelevant collection of items to users of online service providers. Movie Recommendation System aims to recommend movies to users based on content. Given a set of data with their Movie Id, Title, Cast and Crew for a set of movies, can we recommend the movies based on the tags of the movies given in datasets?

## OBJECTIVE

The primary goal of movie recommendation systems is to filter and predict only those movies that a corresponding user is most likely to want to watch. The ML algorithms for these recommendation systems use the data about this user from the systemâ€™s database. This data is used to predict the future behavior of the user concerned based on the information from the past.
